## ⚡ Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jhinusahani/rejouice-clone.git


⚡ Recommendation:  
- Push repo as **`rejouice-clone`**.  
- Use **GitHub Pages** deployment → so you can share live link (`https://jhinusahani.github.io/rejouice-clone`).  
- Add preview screenshots or video demo in README.  


👉 Do you want me to also create a **ready-to-use `script.js` file** (with GSAP + Locomotive + Swiper integration) so your repo looks complete before you upload?
